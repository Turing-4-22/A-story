# Once upon a time in Charleroi, 
I was falling into code.
And found it was a real pleasure...

i confirm it's a real pleasure  
oh God! a real real pleasure  

A bit weird at the beginning,
because functions and object were melting around...

How would you describe the pleasure? is it intense? or exciting ?
